SOLID PRINCIPLES

S - SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE(SRP)
O - OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE (OCP)
L - LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP)
I - INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (ISP)
D - DEPENDENCY INVERSION (DI)


1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (SRP)
   A class should only be responsible for one thing.
2. OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE (OCP)
   Software entities(classes,modules,functions etc..) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   In other words, we can add additional functionality (extension) without modifyting the existing behaviour (modification) of the object.
3. LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP)
   Derived or child classes/structures must be substitutable for their base or parent class.
4. INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (ISP)
   Do not force the client to implement an interface which is irrevelant to them
5. Depedency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   High Level modules should not depend on low level modules, but should depend on abstraction
   If any high level module imports any low level module then the code becomes tightly coupled.
   Changes in one class could break another class.
